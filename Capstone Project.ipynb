the data from the confusion matrix, a couple of interesting discussion points emerge. It could be argued that the Oversampled model (that used SMOTE to create the extra 'TRUE' synthetic records) has performed the most positively as it has made the highest amount of correct predictions, surpassing the baseline Logistic Regression and initial Random Forest models. This means that using the test data, this model predicted the highest amount of correct predictions (both true positives and true negatives) and therefore it can be seen as the 'best' performing model of the 3.\n","\n","However, another interpretation could be that the initial Random Forest model performed most positively with regards to it having the smallest number of false positives. In this scenario, this would be the amount of times a loan is flagged as rejected when it shouldn't be, and by having the smallest amount it means that this model limits the amount of potential lost business that could be incurred due to this incorrect prediction. Therefore, if the businesses' main aim is to minimise losses through this scenario, this model could be deemed the most successful.\n","\n","Ultimately it depends on what the businesses' aims and objectives are, as to how the best performing variant of a machine learning model is determined."],"metadata":{"id":"SFdhWJl9Vq41"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#### *ii. Loss Function*"],"metadata":{"id":"pgZTPoEvJ--S"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["My chosen loss function that I used to evaluate the models was the F1 score. The F1 score combines precision (the amount of positive predictions made by the model that were correct) and recall (the amount of positive class samples in the dataset that were correctly identified by the model) by using their harmonic mean. The F1 score ranges between 0 and 1 and a higher F1 score generally indicates a more positive performance.\n","\n","This is appropriate for this scenario as both the precision and recall values are calculated from values established in the confusion matrix in the previous section, building on their evaluation of each models performance. Also, the F1 score is great to use on imbalanced datasets such as this scenario as its able to acknowledge and create a representative value irrespective of the imbalance due to how its calculated using the precision/recall values.\n","\n","Similar to Part 4 Section 1, I collated the calculated F1 scores into a dataframe and then visualised the results for clearer interpretation:"],"metadata":{"id":"usT44FSgYnKg"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Create comparison table\n","\n","acc_data = {'Logistic Regression Model' : [LR_acc, LR_precision, LR_recall,LR_f1],\n","            'Random Forest Model' : [RFC_acc, RFC_precision, RFC_recall, RFC_f1],\n","            'Random Forest Oversampled Model' : [RFC_acc_O, RFC_precision_O, RFC_recall_O, RFC_f1_O]}\n","\n","df_acc = pd.DataFrame(acc_data)\n","df_acc = df_acc.rename(index={0 : 'Accuracy',\n","                                1 : 'Precision',\n","                                2 : 'Recall',\n","                                3 : 'F1'})\n","\n","df_acc = df_acc.T\n","df_acc= df_acc.apply(pd.to_numeric)\n","df_acc=df_acc.round(2)\n","df_acc"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":143},"id":"LUxWzwO_KDJ4","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1744820971429,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":42,"user":{"displayName":"Tom Hodgson","userId":"02729608637273610310"}},"outputId":"c081bb56-6111-49ee-b8b1-4f386d6cb870"},"execution_count":54,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["                                 Accuracy  Precision  Recall    F1\n","Logistic Regression Model           96.95       0.91    0.83  0.87\n","Random Forest Model                 98.45       0.97    0.90  0.93\n","Random Forest Oversampled Model     98.50       0.95    0.92  0.94"],"text/html":["\n","  <div id=\"df-a10c5338-f57f-4e91-9605-4bc65ac959d6\" class=\"colab-df-container\">\n","    <div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>Accuracy</th>\n","      <th>Precision</th>\n","      <th>Recall</th>\n","      <th>F1</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>Logistic Regression Model</th>\n","      <td>96.95</td>\n","      <td>0.91</td>\n","      <td>0.83</td>\n","      <td>0.87</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>Random Forest Model</th>\n","      <td>98.45</td>\n","      <td>0.97</td>\n","      <td>0.90</td>\n","      <td>0.93</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>Random Forest Oversampled Model</th>\n","      <td>98.50</td>\n","      <td>0.95</td>\n","      <td>0.92</td>\n","      <td>0.94</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","</div>\n","    <div class=\"colab-df-buttons\">\n","\n","  <div class=\"colab-df-container\">\n","    <button class=\"colab-df-convert\" onclick=\"convertToInteractive('df-a10c5338-f57f-4e91-9605-4bc65ac959d6')\"\n","            title=\"Convert this dataframe to an interactive table.\"\n","            style=\"display:none;\">\n","\n","  <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" height=\"24px\" viewBox=\"0 -960 960 960\">\n","    <path d=\"M120-120v-720h720v720H120Zm60-500h600v-160H180v160Zm220 220h160v-160H400v160Zm0 220h160v-160H400v160ZM180-400h160v-160H180v160Zm440 0h160v-160H620v160ZM180-180h160v-160H180v160Zm440 0h160v-160H620v160Z\"/>\n","  </svg>\n","    </button>\n","\n","  <style>\n","    .colab-df-container {\n","      display:flex;\n","      gap: 12px;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-convert {\n","      background-color: #E8F0FE;\n","      border: none;\n","      border-radius: 50%;\n","      cursor: pointer;\n","      display: none;\n","      fill: #1967D2;\n","      height: 32px;\n","      padding: 0 0 0 0;\n","      width: 32px;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-convert:hover {\n","      background-color: #E2EBFA;\n","      box-shadow: 0px 1px 2px rgba(60, 64, 67, 0.3), 0px 1px 3px 1px rgba(60, 64, 67, 0.15);\n","      fill: #174EA6;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-buttons div {\n","      margin-bottom: 4px;\n","    }\n","\n","    [theme=dark] .colab-df-convert {\n","      background-color: #3B4455;\n","      fill: #D2E3FC;\n","    }\n","\n","    [theme=dark] .colab-df-convert:hover {\n","      background-color: #434B5C;\n","      box-shadow: 0px 1px 3px 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15);\n","      filter: drop-shadow(0px 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3));\n","      fill: #FFFFFF;\n","    }\n","  </style>\n","\n","    <script>\n","      const buttonEl =\n","        document.querySelector('#df-a10c5338-f57f-4e91-9605-4bc65ac959d6 button.colab-df-convert');\n","      buttonEl.style.display =\n","        google.colab.kernel.accessAllowed ?

that are labelled as positive, with the aim of minimizing false positives.

Methodology, approach, and model selection rationale*"],"metadata":{"id":"OofnyV20KOaw"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["The methodology for this report was split into distinct parts. In Part 1, I aimed to conduct a thorough preparation & cleaning phase by removing as little as possible and cleaning/enhancing the data as much as possible, with the aim of keeping as much information for the upcoming analysis and eventual machine learning. I believed this would give me ample routes to choose when exploring the data and also provide a wide range of features to choose from when implementing reduction techniques, and by keeping the maximum amount of data and elevating it's quality, I aimed to make better decisions in each subsequent stage as a result.\n","\n","For Part 2, I aimed for the EDA to cover different feature areas and create new features that could complement or improve upon the data that was already there. I found this to be a cyclical process of reviewing the distribution & symmetry of the features, trialling new features within the feature engineering section and then creating visuals to see whether the new features provided any insight or not. With regards to handling outliers, I wanted to use a tried and tested methodology which is why I went with the z-score approach and for the feature reduction section, I wanted to use a combination of different approaches to demonstrate there are multiple viable ways to approach feature reduction.\n","\n","Firstly, I wanted a manual but logical approach in removing features I thought would unfairly give an advantage to the machine learning models later on, based on their description in the data dictionary. Secondly, with the numerical features I wanted to demonstrate a mathematical approach which is why I implemented a reduction function based on the % amount of null values. Lastly, with the non-numerical features I aimed to highlight that supporting data information such as the data dictionary can be really useful and important when choosing which features to take forward.\n","\n","With Part 3, the methodology was to encode the data in the most optimal and appropriate way in a structure that could be reused, should the code need to be productionised and reapplied onto a more up-to-date version of the dataset. I used both one hot and label encoding on the different non-numerical features to ensure I was retaining the original data in the most appropriate format for the upcoming algorithms to learn from and similarly with standardising, I chose to do this as there were different numeric data types on different scales and for the machine learning algorithms to learn most optimally, all the values needed to be on the same scale.\n","\n","I approached the model selection with the aim of firstly setting a benchmark with a well-established, easily-interpretable and explainable model which is why I chose the logistic regression algorithm. Its effectiveness has been well documented and its application on classification problems has also been thoroughly explored, so it seemed and appropriate algorithm to use to set a baseline for this scenario. With regards to my main chosen algorith, the Random Forest, as mentioned in the main notebook I chose it for its efficiency, explainability and robustness to overfitting and noise.\n","\n","In Part 4, I wanted to ensure I chose both accuracy and loss metrics that were appropriate for the type of problem in this scenario. Due to it being a classification problem, both the confusion matrix and the F1 scores were appropriate metrics due to their interpretations of the binary classification predictions. A metric such as the root mean square error wouldn't have been applicable here as that is much more useful in a regression problem, where the model can be evaluated on how far away numerically its prediction is vs the actual value, whereas in the classification problem presented in this scenario there are only two possible prediction values (approved (0) or rejected (1))."],"metadata":{"id":"E7hHXjbzwNo6"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### *ii. Advantages and limitations of the chosen model*"],"metadata":{"id":"pd-B-om0v2Kk"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["One of the main advantages of using the Random Forest model in this scenario was its ability to achieve high accuracy due to how it functions. As it uses several decision trees, with each tree training on a unique subset of data, the Random Forest model aggregates their predictions and subsequently lessens the variation that can be associated with individual trees, resulting in more accurate average predictions. This was important in this scenario as there could be costs incurred such as lost business for making incorrect predictions and the Random Forest innately helps improve the odds in this respect.\n","\n","Another advantage was the Random Forest's resistance to noise vs some other machine learning models. This is because since it uses a combination of predictions and takes the average, noisy data points are unlikely to affect the outcome of every tree in the forest and therefore have less of a chance to affect the performance of the overall model. It was important in this scenario as I believe I retained quite a large amount of features and therefore its likely there could have been a bit of noise within the dataset vs a potentially smaller dataset with less features, so I wanted the Random Forest to help with that as much as possible.\n","\n","One key limitation of the recommended Random Forest model was the lack of interpretability. Whilst the Random Forest has in theory a more explainable structure, the interpretability of how it reaches its end predictions by tracing back through the individual branches, trees etc. can be complicated. Also trying to identify which relationships between features and the effect each has on the overall predictions can be hard to convey as well, which is important in this scenario as its focused on an industry that is heavily regulated and any decisions such as whether to lend an individual money or not needs to be easily explainable to external auditors. The Random Forest presents a problem here as its predictions aren't easily dissected and needs to be carefully considered when deciding on whether to put an algorithm like this into production.\n","\n","Another limitation of the Random Forest model was it can suffer from overfitting and it doesn't have too many hyperparameters to counteract this. Due to its relatively straight-forward structure compared to a model such as neural network, the Random Forest only has 6 hyperparameters and it captures a lot of information in its training data, which sometimes leads to poor generalisation when used on unseen data. If it starts overfitting, there aren't too many hyperparameters than can be used to alter the models structure and therefore I decided to focus more on the oversampling of the training data in this report as I thought it could have a potentially more impactful result on the end predictions, rather than the limited hyperparameter tuning."],"metadata":{"id":"T-z0KQyzwOKD"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### *iii.

This architecture can be seen in the table of contents and the labelled headings.\n","\n","With regards to the architecture of the final model, this was a Random Forest model that used oversampled training data to learn from and then test on 30% of the loaded records.

Considerations on deployment and scalability of the solution*"],"metadata":{"id":"-MlQ4Cq9v5fa"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["There are a few considerations with regards to deployment and the scalability of the proposed final solution.\n","\n","Firstly regarding deployment, it's recommended that the core code for the preparation pipeline, EDA, modelling and evaluation is all stored in a GIT repository. This would allow multiple members of a team to access the code and work on developing/expanding/updating different parts of the solution in separate development branches without affecting the main model in use.\n","\n","A GIT repository also provides a comprehensive audit history of any changes made and by who, which should help with one of the models limitations in its interpretability as should any auditors ask to see what changes have been made to the model, they can easily be presented.\n","\n","With regards to scalability, choosing a strong infrastructure is key to ensure its potential growth won't be impeded by technical restrictions. This can relate to the type of interface the model is being accessed through, such as a PyCharm app, but also the cloud infrastructure that the model could potentially be deployed to. Technical mechanisms such as API calls, server hosting and upkeep costs must be considered alongside the potential amount of users expected to use the final solution and how often they could be running predictions to output results.\n","\n","Therefore to assist with scalability, its recommended the business considers creating systematic diagrams using platforms such as draw.io to identify who the main stakeholders are going to be, what the deployment architecture could look like and where could be areas of weakness or issues. By doing this and optimising the final solution as much as possible, it should lead to both an improved initial deployment and smoother future scalability.

Without the model and if these loans had been approved and subsequently defaulted on, at an estimated cost to the business of say £5,000 for the average lost repayment values (which is half of the most common loan amount of £10,000 identified in the EDA section), along with potential other internal admin expenses etc., the business could have saved itself £16.3m in sunk costs over the 13 year period the dataset was collected in, averaging at just under £1m a year saving.\n","\n","The net cost would be lower as it would have to take into account the money required to set up the data science team to build and monitor such a prediction model, the architecture costs and other associated costs with maintaining the solution, however the immediate monetary return could be well worth undertaking the project once a business case is fully put together and presented to the business for approval."],"metadata":{"id":"7Ap6T7EfwPqy"}}]}
