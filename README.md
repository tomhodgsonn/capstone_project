# My Capstone Project
This repository contains my capstone project notebook that includes the full data pipeline for the predictive models used on Lending Club's loan application dataset.

## Installation
The project notebook should be able to be opened in either Google Colab or Anaconda/Jupyter and contains all the code to import the relevant libraries used within the code cells themselves.

## Issues
Please message me on Google Classrooms if there is any problems opening or running the notebook.
